<p>
We consider a Fictitious Domain formulation of an elliptic partial differential equation and approximate the resulting saddle-point system using a nested inexact preconditioned Uzawa iterative algorithm, which consists of 3 nested loops. In the outer loop the trial space for the Galerkin approximation of the Lagrange multiplier is enlarged. The intermediate loop solves this Galerkin system by a damped preconditioned Richardson iteration. Each iteration of the latter involves solving an elliptic problem on the fictitious domain whose solution is approximated by an adaptive finite element method in the inner loop. We prove that the overall method converges with the best possible rate and illustrate numerically our theoretical findings.
