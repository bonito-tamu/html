  free surfaces</a>. <br>
Bonito, A. and Picasso, M. and Laso, M.
<p>
A numerical model is presented for the simulation of 
viscoelastic flows with complex free surfaces in three space dimensions. 
The mathematical formulation of 
the model is similar to that of the 
volume of fluid (VOF) method, but the numerical procedures are different. 
</p>
<p>
A splitting method is used for the time discretization. 
The prediction step consists
in solving three advection problems, one for the volume fraction of liquid
(which allows the new liquid domain to be obtained), 
one for the 
velocity field, one for the
extra-stress.
The correction step corresponds to
solving an Oldroyd-B fluid flow problem without advection 
in the new liquid domain.
</p>
<p>
Two different grids are used for the space discretization. 
The three advection problems are solved on a fixed, structured grid made 
out of small cubic cells, using a forward characteristics method. 
The Oldroyd-B problem without advection
is solved using continuous, piecewise
linear stabilized finite elements on a fixed, unstructured mesh
 of tetrahedrons.
</p>
<p>
Efficient post-processing algorithms enhance the quality of 
the numerical solution. A hierarchical data
structure reduces the memory requirements.
</p>
<p>
Convergence of the numerical method is checked for the pure 
extensional flow and the filling of a tube.
Numerical results are presented for the stretching of a filament.
Fingering instabilities are obtained when the aspect ratio is large.
Also, results pertaining to jet buckling are reported.
