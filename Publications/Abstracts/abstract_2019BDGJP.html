Motivated by numerical methods for solving parametric partial differential equations, this paper studies the approximation of multivariate analytic functions by algebraic polynomials. We introduce various anisotropic  model  classes based on Taylor expansions, and study their approximation by finite dimensional polynomial spaces $\mathcal P_\Lambda$ described by lower sets $\Lambda$.  Given a budget $n$ for the dimension of $\mathcal P_\Lambda$, we prove that certain lower sets  $\Lambda_n$, with cardinality $n$, provide a  certifiable approximation error that is in a certain sense optimal, and that these lower sets have a simple definition in terms of simplices. Our main goal is to obtain approximation results  when  the number of variables $d$ is large and even infinite, and so we concentrate almost exclusively on the case $d=\infty$.   We also emphasize obtaining results which hold for the full range $n\ge 1$, rather than  asymptotic results that only hold for  $n $   sufficiently large.  In applications, one typically wants $n$ small to comply with computational budgets.
