		<p>
		  A reflected diffusion process is proposed for modeling of
		  viscoelastic fluids. In order to define the viscoelastic stress
		  tensor, the reflected diffusion process is approximated by It&ocirc;
		  diffusions with penalization factor in the drift term. Convergence
		  of the stress tensor approximation is proved and an expression
		  for the limiting stress tensor in terms of the reflected process
		  itself is provided.
