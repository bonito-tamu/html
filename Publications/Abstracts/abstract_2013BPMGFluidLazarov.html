<a name="2012BPMGFluidLB">A multigrid algorithm for an elliptic problem with a
  perturbed boundary condition</a>. 
<br>
Bonito, A. and Pasciak, J.E.
<p>
We discuss the preconditioning of systems coupling elliptic operators in &Omega;&sub;&#8477;<sup>d</sup>, d=2,3, 
with elliptic operators defined on hyper-surfaces.
These systems arise naturally 
when physical phenomena are affected by geometric boundary forces, such as the 
evolution of liquid drops subject to surface tension.  The resulting
operators are sums of interior and boundary terms 
 weighted by parameters.    
We investigate the behavior of  multigrid algorithms 
suited to this context  and demonstrate numerical results 
which suggest uniform preconditioning bounds that are  level and
parameter independent.
