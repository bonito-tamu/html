  flows: deterministic and stochastic models</a>. <br>
Bonito, A.
<p>
Mathematical and numerical aspects of viscoelastic flows are investigated here.
</p>
<p>
Two simplified mathematical models are considered. 
They are motivated by a splitting algorithm for solving viscoelastic flows with free surfaces.
The first model is a simplified Oldroyd-B model. 
Existence on a fixed time interval is proved in several Banach spaces
provided the data are small enough. 
Short time existence is also proved for arbitrarily large data in H&ouml;lder spaces for the time variable.
These results are based on the maximal regularity property of the Stokes operator and on the analycity behavior of the corresponding semi-group.
A finite element discretization in space is then proposed. Existence of the
numerical solution is proved for small data, as well as a priori error estimates, using an implicit function theorem framework.
Then, the extension of these results to a stochastic simplified Hookean dumbbells model is discussed.
Because of the presence of the Brownian motion, existence in a fixed time interval, provided the data are small enough, is proved only in some of the Banach spaces considered previously.
The dumbbells' elongation is split in two parts, one satisfying a standart stochastic differential equation, the other satisfying a partial differential equation with a stochastic source term.
A finite element discretization in space is also proposed. 
Existence of the numerical solution is proved for small data, as well as a priori error estimates.
</p>
<p>
A numerical algorithm for solving viscoelastic flows with free surfaces is also described.
This algorithm is based on a splitting method in time and two different meshes are used for the space discretization. 
Convergence of the numerical model is checked for the pure extensional flow and the filling of a pipe.
Then, numerical results are reported for the stretching of a filament
and for jet buckling.
