<p>
We study the numerical approximation of fractional powers of accretive
operators in this paper.  Namely, if $A$ is the accretive operator
associated with a regular sesquilinear form $A(\cdot,\cdot)$ defined
 on a Hilbert space
$\mathbb V$ contained in  $L^2(\Omega)$, we approximate
$A^{-\beta}$ for $\beta\in (0,1)$.   The fractional powers are defined
in terms of the so-called Balakrishnan integral formula.

Given a finite element approximation space $\mathbb V_h\subset \mathbb V$,
$A^{-\beta}$ is approximated by $A_h^{-\beta}\pi_h$ where $A_h$ is
the operator associated with the form $A(\cdot,\cdot)$  restricted to
$\mathbb V_h$ and $\pi_h$ is the $L^2(\Omega)$-projection onto $\mathbb V_h$.
We first provide error estimates for $(A^\beta-A_h^{\beta}\pi_h)f$ in Sobolev
norms with index in [0,1] for appropriate $f$. These results depend on
elliptic regularity properties of variational solutions involving the
form $A(\cdot,\cdot)$ and are valid for the case of less than full
elliptic regularity.
We also construct and analyze an exponentially convergent sinc
quadrature approximation to the Balakrishnan integral defining
$A_h^{\beta}\pi_h f$.  Finally, the results
of numerical computations illustrating the proposed
method are given.
