<a name="2008BB">A continuous interior penalty method for viscoelastic
  flows</a>. <br>
Bonito, A. and Burman, E.

<p>
In this paper we consider a finite element discretization of the Oldroyd-B model of viscoelastic
flows. The method uses standard continuous polynomial finite element spaces for velocities, pressures and stresses. 
Inf-sup stability and stability for convection-dominated flows are obtained by adding a term penalizing the jump 
of the solution gradient over element faces. To increase robustness when the Deborah number is high we 
add a non-linear artificial viscosity of shock-capturing type. The method is analyzed on a linear model problem,
optimal a priori error estimates are proven that are independent of the solvent viscosity. Finally we 
demonstrate the performance of the method on some known benchmark cases.
