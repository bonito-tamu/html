<a name="2006BCP">Finite element of a simplified stochastic Hookean
  dumbbells model arising from viscoelastic flows</a>. <br>
Bonito, A. and Cl&eacute;ment, Ph. and Picasso, M.
<p>
A simplified stochastic Hookean dumbbells model arising from viscoelastic flows is considered, the convective terms being disregarded. 
A finite element discretization in space is proposed. 
Existence of the numerical solution is proved for small data, so as a priori error estimates,
using an implicit function theorem and regularity results obtained in
<a href="#2006BCPb">[2006BCPb]</a> for the solution of the continuous problem. A posteriori error estimates are also derived.
Numerical results with small time steps and a large number of realizations confirm the
convergence rate with respect to the mesh size.
