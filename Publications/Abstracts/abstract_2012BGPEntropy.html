<a name="2012BGPEntropy">Stability Analysis of the Explicit Entropy Viscosity Method for Scalar Non-Linear Conservation Laws</a>.

Bonito, A. and Guermond, J.-L. and Popov, B.
<p>
 We establish the L<sup>2</sup>-stability of an entropy viscosity technique
  applied to nonlinear scalar conservation equations.  First- and
  second-order explicit time-stepping techniques using continuous
  finite elements in space are considered. The method is shown to be
  stable independently of the polynomial degree of the space
  approximation under the standard CFL condition.
