		<p>
		  We study numerically the interplay of <i>surface topography</i> and <i>kinetics</i> in the relaxation of crystal surface corrugations below roughening in two independent space dimensions. The kinetic processes
		  are <i>isotropic</i> diffusion of adatoms across terraces and attachment-detachment
		  of atoms at steps. We simulate the corresponding <i>anisotropic</i> partial differential
		  equation for the surface height via the <i>finite element method</i>. The numerical results show a sharp transition from initial
		  biperiodic surface profiles to one-dimensional surface morphologies. This transition
		  is found to be enhanced by an applied electric field. Our predictions demonstrate the
		  dramatic influence on morphological relaxation of <i>geometry-induced</i> asymmetries
		  in the adatom fluxes transverse and parallel to step edges.
