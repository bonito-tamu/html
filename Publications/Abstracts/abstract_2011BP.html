<a name="2011BP">Convergence Analysis of Variational and non-Variational Multigrid Algorithms for the
  Laplace-Beltrami Operator</a>. 
<br>
Bonito, A. and Pasciak, J.E.
<p>
We design and analyze  variational and non-variational multigrid
algorithms  for the Laplace-Beltrami operator on a smooth and closed
surface. 
In both cases, a uniform convergence for the V-cycle algorithm
is obtained provided the surface
geometry is  captured well enough by the coarsest grid.
The main argument hinges on a perturbation analysis from an auxiliary
variational algorithm defined directly on the smooth surface.
In addition, the vanishing mean value constraint is imposed on each
level, thereby avoiding singular quadratic forms without adding
additional computational cost.

Numerical results supporting our analysis are reported.
In particular, the algorithms perform well even when applied 
to surfaces with a large aspect ratio.
