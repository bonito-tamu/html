An Interior Penalty Method with C<sup>0</sup> Finite Elements for the
    Approximation of the Maxwell Equations in Heterogeneous Media:
    Convergence Analysis with Minimal Regularity

		<p>
The present paper proposes and analyzes an
    interior penalty technique using C<sup>0</sup>-finite elements to solve
  the Maxwell equations in domains with heterogeneous properties. The
  convergence analysis for the boundary value problem and the
    eigenvalue problem is done assuming only minimal regularity in
  Lipschitz domains. The method is shown to converge for any
  polynomial degrees and to be spectrally correct.
