Bonito, A. and Lei, Wenyu and Pasciak, J.E.
<p>
In this paper, we develop a numerical scheme for the space-time fractional parabolic
equation, i.e., an equation involving a fractional time derivative 
and a fractional spatial operator.   Both the initial value problem and the non-homogeneous forcing
problem (with zero initial data) are considered.     The solution
operator $E(t)$ for the
initial value problem can be written as a Dunford-Taylor integral
involving the  Mittag-Leffler function $e_{\alpha,1}$ and the resolvent
of the underlying (non-fractional) spatial operator   over
an appropriate integration path in the complex plane. Here $\alpha$ denotes the order of
the fractional time derivative.   
The solution for
the non-homogeneous problem can be written as a 
convolution involving an operator $W(t)$ and the forcing function
$F(t)$.

We develop and analyze semi-discrete methods
based on finite element approximation to the underlying (non-fractional)
spatial operator in terms of analogous Dunford-Taylor integrals applied to the
discrete operator.   The space error is of optimal order  up to a logarithm of $1/h$.
The fully discrete method for the initial value
problem is developed from the semi-discrete approximation by  applying a
sinc quadrature technique  
 to approximate the Dunford-Taylor intgral
of the discrete operator and is free of any time stepping.    The sinc
quadrature of step size $k$  involves $k^{-2}$ nodes and results in an additional
 $O(\exp(-c/k))$ error.

To approximate the convolution appearing in the semi-discrete
approximation to the non-homogeneous problem, we apply a pseudo midpoint
quadrature. This involves the average of $W_h(s)$, (the semi-discrete
approximation to $W(s)$) over the quadrature interval.  This average 
can also be written as a
Dunford-Taylor integral.  We first analyze the error between this
quadrature and the semi-discrete approximation.   To develop a fully
discrete method, we then introduce sinc quadrature approximations to the
Dunford-Taylor integrals for  computing the averages.     
We show that for 
a refined grid in time with a mesh of $O(\mathcal N\log(\mathcal N))$ intervals, the
error between the semi-discrete and fully discrete approximation 
is  $O(\mathcal N^{-2}+\log(\mathcal N) \exp(-c/k))$.    We also report the results of numerical experiments
that are in
agreement with the theoretical error estimates.
