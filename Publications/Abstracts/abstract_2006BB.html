  equation arising from Oldroyd-B viscoelastic flows</a>. <br>
Bonito, A. and Burman, E.
<p>
We apply the continuous interior penalty method to the three fields Stokes problem. 
We prove an inf-sup condition for the proposed method leading to optimal a priori error 
estimates for smooth exact solutions. Moreover we propose an iterative algorithm for 
the separate solution of the velocities and the pressures on the one hand and the extra-stress on the other. The stability of the iterative algorithm is established.
