Partial differential equations posed on surfaces arise in a number of applications.  
In this survey we describe three popular finite element methods for approximating solutions to the Laplace-Beltrami problem posed on an $n$-dimensional surface $\gamma$ embedded in $\mathbb{R}^{n+1}$:  the <i>parametric</i>, <i>trace</i>, and <i>narrow band</i> methods.  
</p>
<p>The parametric method entails constructing an approximating polyhedral surface $\Gamma$ whose faces comprise the finite element triangulation.  
The finite element method is then posed over the approximate surface $\Gamma$ in a manner very similar to standard FEM on Euclidean domains.  
In the trace method it is assumed that the given surface $\gamma$ is embedded in an $n+1$-dimensional domain $\Omega$ which has itself been triangulated.
An $n$-dimensional approximate surface $\Gamma$ is then constructed roughly speaking by interpolating $\gamma$ over the triangulation of $\Omega$, and the finite element space over $\Gamma$ consists of the trace (restriction) of a standard finite element space on $\Omega$ to $\Gamma$.  
In the narrow band method the PDE posed on the surface is extended to a triangulated $n+1$-dimensional band about $\gamma$ whose width is proportional to the diameter of elements in the triangulation.  
</p>
<p>
In all cases we provide optimal a priori error estimates for the lowest-order finite element methods, and we also present a posteriori error estimates for the parametric and trace methods.  
Our presentation focuses especially on the relationship between the regularity of the surface $\gamma$, which is never assumed better than of class $C^2$, the manner in which $\gamma$ is represented in theory and practice, and the properties of the resulting methods.
