		<p>
		  A numerical method for the simulation of fluid flows with complex free surfaces is presented. The liquid is assumed to be a Newtonian or a viscoelastic fluid. The compressible effects of the surrounding gas are taken into account, as well as surface tension forces.
		  An Eulerian approach based on the volume-of-fluid formulation is chosen. 
		  A time splitting algorithm, together with a two-grids method, allows the various physical phenomena to be decoupled.
		  A chronological approach is adopted to highlight the successive improvements of the model and the wide range of applications. 
		  Numerical results show the potentialities of the method.
