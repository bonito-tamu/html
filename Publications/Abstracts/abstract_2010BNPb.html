<a name="2010BNPb">Geometrically Consistent Mesh Modifications</a>.

Bonito, A. and Nochetto, R.H. and Pauletti, M.S.
<p>
A new paradigm of adaptivity is to execute
refinement, coarsening, and smoothing of meshes
on manifolds with incomplete information about their geometry
and yet preserve position and curvature accuracy.
We refer to this collectively as geometrically consistent mesh modification.
We discuss the concept of discrete geometric consistency, show the failure
of naive approaches, and propose and analyze a simple algorithm
that is geometrically consistent and accuracy preserving.
