		Bonito, A. and Casc&oacute;n, J.M. and Mekchay, K. and Morin, P. and Nochetto, R.H.
		<p>
We present a new AFEM for the Laplace-Beltrami operator 
with arbitrary polynomial degree on parametric
surfaces, which are globally $W^1_\infty$ and piecewise in a
suitable Besov class embedded in $C^{1,\alpha}$ with $\alpha \in (0,1]$.
The idea is to have the surface
sufficiently well resolved in $W^1_\infty$ relative to the current
resolution of the PDE in $H^1$. This gives rise to a conditional contractionproperty of the PDE module. We present a suitable approximation class
and discuss its relation to Besov regularity of the surface,
solution, and forcing.
We prove optimal convergence rates for AFEM which are dictated
by the worst decay rate of the surface error
in $W^1_\infty$ and PDE error in $H^1$.
