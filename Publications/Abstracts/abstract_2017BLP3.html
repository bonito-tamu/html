Bonito, A. and Lei, Wenyu and Pasciak, J.E.
<p>
We consider the finite element approximation of fractional powers of regularly accretive operators via the Dunford-Taylor integral approach. 
We use a sinc quadrature scheme to approximate the Balakrishnan representation of the negative powers of the operator as well as its finite element approximation. 
We improve the exponentially convergent error estimates from [A. Bonito, J. E. Pasciak, IMA J. Numer. Anal. (2016) 00, 1-29] by reducing the regularity required on the data. 
Numerical experiments illustrating the new theory are provided.nconforming finite element algorithm to approximate the solution to the elliptic problem involving the fractional Laplacian.
