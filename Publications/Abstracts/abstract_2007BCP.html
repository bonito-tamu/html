<p>
A time-dependent model corresponding to
an Oldroyd-B viscoelastic fluid
is considered, the convective terms being disregarded. 
Global existence in time is proved in Banach spaces
provided the data are small enough, using the implicit function theorem
and a maximum regularity property for a three fields Stokes problem.
A finite element discretization in space is then proposed. Existence of the
numerical solution is proved for small data, so as a priori error estimates,
using again an implicit function theorem.
