Arbitrary Lagrangian Eulerian (ALE) formulations 
deal with PDEs on deformable domains upon extending the domain
velocity from the boundary into the bulk with the purpose of keeping
mesh regularity. This arbitrary extension has no effect on the
stability of the PDE but may influence that of a discrete scheme.
We examine this critical issue for higher order time stepping without
space discretization.
We propose time-discrete discontinuous Galerkin (dG) numerical schemes of
any order for a time-dependent advection-diffusion model problem in
moving domains, and study their stability properties. The analysis hinges on the validity of the Reynolds' identity for dG.
Exploiting the variational structure and assuming
exact integration, we prove that our conservative and non-conservative
dG schemes are equivalent and unconditionally stable.
The same results remain true for piecewise polynomial ALE maps of any
degree and suitable quadrature that guarantees the validity of
the Reynolds' identity.
This approach generalizes the so-called geometric
conservation law (GCL) to higher order methods.
We also prove that simpler Runge-Kutta-Radau (RKR) methods of any order
are conditionally stable, that is subject to a
mild ALE constraint on the time steps.
Numerical experiments corroborate and complement our theoretical results.
