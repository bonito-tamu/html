		<p>
We present a mathematical model of polymer bilayers that
undergo large bending deformations when actuated by non-mechanical
stimuli such as thermal effects. The simple model captures a
large class of nonlinear bending effects and can be
discretized with standard plate elements. We devise a 
fully practical iterative scheme and apply it to the simulation
of folding of several practically useful
compliant structures comprising of thin elastic layers.
