Bonito, A. and Nochetto, R.H. and Pauletti, M.S.
<p>
We derive a biomembrane model consisting of a fluid enclosed by a
lipid membrane.
The membrane is characterized by its Canham-Helfrich energy (Willmore energy
with area constraint) and acts as a
boundary force 
on the Navier-Stokes system modeling an incompressible fluid. 
We give a concise description of the model and of the associated numerical scheme.
We provide numerical simulations with emphasis on 
the comparisons between different types of flow:
the geometric model which does not take into account the bulk fluid
and the biomembrane model for two different regimes of parameters.
