		Bonito, A. and Nochetto, R.H.
		<p>
		  We analyze an adaptive discontinuous finite element method (ADFEM) 
		  for symmetric second order linear elliptic operators.
		  The method is formulated on nonconforming meshes made of simplices or 
		  quadrilaterals,
		  with any polynomial degree and in any dimension &ge; 2.
		  We prove that the ADFEM is a contraction for the sum of the energy
		  error and the scaled error estimator, between two consecutive adaptive
		  loops. 
		  We design a refinement procedure that maintains the level of
		  nonconformity uniformly bounded, and prove that the approximation classes
		  using continuous and discontinuous finite elements are equivalent.
		  The geometric decay and the equivalence of classes are instrumental
		  to derive optimal cardinality of ADFEM. We show that ADFEM (and AFEM
		  on nonconforming meshes) yields a decay
		  rate of energy error plus oscillation in terms of number of degrees of freedom
		  as dictated by the best approximation for this combined nonlinear quantity.
