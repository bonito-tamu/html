		  We present a mixed finite element method for a model of the flow in a Hele-Shaw cell of 2-D fluid droplets surrounded by air driven by surface tension and actuated by an electric field.  The application of interest regards a micro-fluidic device called ElectroWetting on Dielectric (EWOD).  Our analysis first focuses on the time-discrete (continuous in space) problem and is presented in a mixed variational framework, which incorporates curvature as a natural boundary condition.  The model includes a viscous damping term for interface motion, as well as contact line pinning (sticking of the interface) and is captured in our formulation by a variational inequality.  The semi-discrete problem uses a semi-implicit time-discretization of curvature.  We prove the well-posedness of the semi-discrete problem and fully discrete problem when discretized with iso-parametric finite elements.  We derive a priori error estimates for the space discretization.  We also prove the convergence of an Uzawa algorithm for solving the semi-discrete EWOD system with inequality constraint.  We conclude with a discussion about experimental orders of convergence.
