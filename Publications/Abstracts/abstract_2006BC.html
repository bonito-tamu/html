<a name="2006BC">A Remark on a Theorem of Dore Concerning 
Lp Maximal Regularity</a>. <br/>
Bonito, A. and Clement, Ph.
<p>
The aim of this note is to show that for the necessary conditions
in Theorems 2.1 and 2.2 in <em>Dore (1991)</em>, the operator A does not have to be densely defined. Evenmore, when the space X is reflexive this assumption becomes a
conclusion. An application to the regularity of the Stokes problem is given.
