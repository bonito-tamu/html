<h2>Course description and prerequisites</h2> Credit 3.0.
This is a one-semester introductory course on partial differential equations. 
<a class="emph">It is impossible to cover all the material provided in the textbook and some material will be omitted.</a>
We will concentrate on classical explicit solution techniques for linear differential equations and understanding the properties of the solutions thus obtained. Specific types of solution methods include separation of variables, Fourier techniques, Green's functions, and the method of characteristics. Classification of partial differential equations and differences between properties of solutions of PDE in various classes will also be an important theme in the course. We will cover most of Chapters 1-4 and 12 of the text, along with portions of Chapters 9 and 10 as time allows. Prerequisite: MATH 308 or MATH 451 or approval of instructor.
<br/>

<h2>Minimal Outcome</h2> 
Formulation and solution of partial differential equations of mathematical physics; Fourier series and transform methods, complex variable methods, methods of characteristics and first order equations.

<h2>Homework, Quizzes and Matlab Assignements</h2> 
<p>
Homework assignments and due dates will be posted on the course website (usually over the week-end). I expect there to be roughly one assignment per non-exam week, with a total of about 10 during the semester. Late homework will not be accepted except in cases of excused absences (see below). However, your lowest homework score will be dropped. 
I encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, including strategies for
solving different kinds of problems. However, the redaction is individal and every student must return is own solutions.  
The purpose of these homework assignments is that you
obtain practice in the techniques discussed in class. 
Solving the problems diligently is therefore
a vital component of your learning experience and will also prepare you for the exams. 
</p>


<h2>Office Hours</h2>
You have priority over graduate students and other people I work with
during my office hours.
You are welcome to stop by without appointment during the office
hours.
<a class="emph">Please use the office hours!</a>
If you are not able to come during regular office hours,
you still have the possibility to schedule 
an appointment by email,
I will do my best to be available.


<h2>Grading Policies</h2> 
Examination dates and the recipe for your final grade are as follows:
<ul>
<li> Homeworks: 30 %</li> 
<li> Midterm: 30 %, October 18</li>
<li> Final: 40 %,  December 9, 12:30 - 2:30 pm</li>
</ul>

<p>
See <a href="2016_Fall_Syllabus_Addendum.html">Syllabus Addendum</a> for a modification (in you favor).
</p>
<p>
The final is cumulative.
</p>
<p>
You have the possibility to check your grades via
the <a href="http://ecampus.tamu.edu" target="_blank">ecampus</a> website.
<a class="emph">It is your responsability to verify that the grades reported online corresponds
to your actual grade</a>. The grades on elearning range from 0 to 100, "M" means that you missed the test and "E" means that you provided a valid excuse. 
</p>
<p>
The final <a class="emph">minimum</a> grade will be A, B, C, or D, for averages of 90%, 80%, 65%, or 50%, respectively. 
</p>

<h2>Absences</h2>
<p>
I request that absences including for religious holy day are announced the first two weeks
of classes. 
When possible, other absences have to be arranged two weeks
prior the exam day.
</p>

<p>
Excused absences for the exams and final according to Rule seven
(see Student Rules) will be dealt with on an individual basis, 
but require convincing documentation. 
</p>

<p>Make-ups will <a class="emph">only</a> be given for university official excuses.
</p>

<h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</h2>
<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides
comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation
requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for
reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact Disability Services, in Cain Hall, Room B118, or call 845-1637. For
additional information visit <a href="http://disability.tamu.edu">http://disability.tamu.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</h2>
<p>
The Aggie Honor Code <a class="emph">''An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate
those who do''</a> applies, see also the Honor Council Rules and Procedures at
<a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu">http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu</a>.
Students are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss homework problems with each
other. However, copying or stealing work done by others is an act of academic dishonesty and
will be persecuted according to the University policy.
