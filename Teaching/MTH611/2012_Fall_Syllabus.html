phase portraits, vector fields. 
Partial differential equations of first order, method of characteristics. 
Basic linear partial differential equations: Laplace equation, heat (diffusion) equation, wave
equation and transport equation. 
Solution techniques and qualitative properties. 
<br/>

<h2>Prerequisite</h2>
MATH 410 or equivalent or instructor's approval. 
<br/>

<h2>Homework Assignements</h2> 
<p>
Homeworks will be assigned in a frequent basis. 
They will be announced in class and posted on the class web site.

<h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</h2>
<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides
comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation
requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for
reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact Disability Services, in Cain Hall, Room B118, or call 845-1637. For
additional information visit <a href="http://disability.tamu.edu">http://disability.tamu.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</h2>
<p>
The Aggie Honor Code <a class="emph">''An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate
those who do''</a> applies, see also the Honor Council Rules and Procedures at
<a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu">http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu</a>.
Students are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss homework problems with each
other. However, copying or stealing work done by others is an act of academic dishonesty and
will be persecuted according to the University policy.
