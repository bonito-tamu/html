<p><a class="title">Minimal Outcome. </a> 
This course is to provide students with quantitative and
problem-solving skills for first order, 
linear second order and systems of linear differential equations. 
At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to:
<ul>
<li> Understand the concepts of solution, initial value problem and direction field.</li>
<li> Solve first order linear differential equations.</li>
<li> Solve second order homogeneous and non-homogeneous linear ODEs.</li>
<li> Use elimination method to solve systems with constant coefficients.</li>
<li> Use matrix methods to solve linear systems of ODEs/</li>
<li> Use Laplace transform methods to solve linear systems of ODEs.</li>
<li> Understand and apply basic numerical methods for solving.</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="title">Homework and Quizzes. </a> 
Homework will be assigned weekly every Saturday but not collected.
They will not be announced in class but be posted on the class web site
one week prior the due date.
I encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, including strategies for
solving different kinds of problems. 
The purpose of these homework assignments is that you
obtain practice in the techniques discussed in class. 
Solving the problems diligently is therefore
a vital component of your learning experience and will also prepare you for the quizzes and
exams. 
</p>

<p>
On a weekly to biweekly basis on the due dates we will have a brief quiz (closed book, closed notes)
with problem related to assigned homework. 
</p>

<p><a class="title">Office Hours. </a>
You have priority over graduate students and other people I work with
during my office hours.
You are welcome to stop by without appointment during the office
hours.
<em>Please use the office hours!</em>
If you are not able to come during regular office hours,
you still have the possibility to schedule 
an appointment by email,
I will do my best to be available.


<p><a class="title">Grading Policies. </a> 
Examination dates and the recipe for your final grade are as follows:
<ul>
<li> Quizzes: 25 %</li> 
<li> Midterm 1 (March 1st): 25 %</li>
<li> Midterm 2 (April 26th): 25 %</li> 
<li> Final (May 9th): 25 %</li>
</ul>

<p><a class="title">Absences. </a>
I request that absences including for religious holy day are announced the first two weeks
of classes. 
When possible, other absences have to be arranged two weeks
prior the exam day.
</p>

<p>
Excused absences for the midterm exam and final according to Rule seven
(see Student Rules) will be dealt with on an individual basis, 
but require convincing documentation. 
</p>

<p>Make-ups will <em>not</em> be given for quizzes. 
However if you miss a quiz due to an authorized absence and you
contact me immediately then the missed quiz will not count.
</p>

<p><a class="title">Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</a>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides
comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation
requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for
reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact Disability Services, in Cain Hall, Room B118, or call 845-1637. For
additional information visit <a href="http://disability.tamu.edu">http://disability.tamu.edu</a>.
</p>

<p><a class="title">Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</a>
The Aggie Honor Code ''An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate
those who do'' applies, see also the Honor Council Rules and Procedures at
<a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu">http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu</a>.
Students are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss homework problems with each
other. However, copying or stealing work done by others is an act of academic dishonesty and
will be persecuted according to the University policy.
