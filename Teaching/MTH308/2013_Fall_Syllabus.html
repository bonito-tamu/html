<h2>Course description and prerequisites</h2> Credit 3.0.
Ordinary differential equations, solutions in series, solutions using Laplace transforms, systems of differential equations. Prerequisites: MATH 251 or equivalent; knowledge of computer algebra system. 
<br/>

<a class="emph">It is impossible to cover all the material provided in the textbook and some material will be omitted.</a>

<h2>Minimal Outcome</h2> 
This course is to provide students with quantitative and
problem-solving skills for first order, 
linear second order and systems of linear differential equations. 
At the conclusion of this course, students should be able to:
<ul>
<li> Understand the concepts of solution, initial value problem and direction field.</li>
<li> Solve first order linear differential equations.</li>
<li> Solve second order homogeneous and non-homogeneous linear ODEs.</li>
<li> Solve system of linear equations.</li>
<li> Derive qualitative behavior of solutions nonlinear ODEs.</li>
<li> Understand and apply basic numerical methods for solving.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Homeworks, Quizzes and Matlab Project</h2> 
<p>
Homework will be assigned weekly every Saturday but not collected.
They will not be announced in class but be posted on the class web site
one week prior the due date.
I encourage you to discuss homework problems with your classmates, including strategies for
solving different kinds of problems. 
The purpose of these homework assignments is that you
obtain practice in the techniques discussed in class. 
Solving the problems diligently is therefore
a vital component of your learning experience and will also prepare you for the quizzes and
exams. 
<a target="_blank" href="/courses/helpsessions.html">Help sessions</a> and 
<a target="_blank" href="http://such-that.com/TAMU/Math-308-Week-In-Review.php">week in review</a> are offered by the department of mathematics.
However, the schedule for the week in review may not correspond to the topics discussed in class.
</p>

<p>
On a weekly basis on the due dates (usually on Tuesday), we will have a 5-minute quiz (closed book, closed notes)
with problem closely related to assigned homework. 
</p>

<p>
Due to new Texas A&amp;M regulation, the quizzes and exams are not returned in class anymore. 
Instead, you are welcome to pick your copies up during office hours.
However, note that any discussion on your grade will be only possible within 3 weeks (starting at the quiz date). 
</p>

<p>
The weekly homeworks may contain matlab exercises.
I strongly encourage you to consider them to gain insights on the
behavior of ODEs.  
Moreover, an optional take-home matlab project will be assigned on due time.
Students can work in groups of at most three.
There is no report to return but the project grade is determined after an oral examination where, in particular, each group will be asked to run and explain the matlab codes and results obtained.
Help session for matlab are provided by the department of mathematics, visit
<a target="_blank" href="/courses/calclabhelp.html">Calc Lab</a>.
</p>

<h2>Office Hours</h2>
You have priority over graduate students and other people I work with
during my office hours.
You are welcome to stop by without appointment during the office
hours.
<a class="emph">Please use the office hours!</a>
If you are not able to come during regular office hours,
you still have the possibility to schedule 
an appointment by email,
I will do my best to be available.


<h2>Grading Policies</h2> 
Examination dates and the recipe for your final grade are as follows:

If the matlab project is not returned:
<ul>
<li> Quizzes: 25 %</li> 
<li> Exam 1: 25 %, Oct 8</li>
<li> Exam 2: 25 %, Nov 26</li> 
<li> Final: 25 %, Dec 11, 1-3pm, venue TBA</li>
</ul>

If the matlab project is returned:
<ul>
<li> Quizzes: 20 %</li> 
<li> Exam 1: 20 %, Oct 8</li>
<li> Exam 2: 20 %, Nov 26</li> 
<li> Matlab project: 20 %, TBA</li> 
<li> Final: 20 %,  Dec 11, 1-3pm, venue TBA</li>
</ul>


<p>
The lowest quiz is dropped. 
Exam 2 is not cumulative, the Final is.  
Notice that the date for Exam 2 is at the end of the semester to save study time
for the Final.
Moreover, students returning the matlab project and with a pre-final grade of above 90% are not required to take the final and receive an automatic A.
The pre-final grade is determined as the average between the Quizzes, Exam 1 and 2, and Matlab project grades (if returned).
</p>
<p>
You have the possibility to check their grades via
the <a href="http://ecampus.tamu.edu" target="_blank">ecampus</em> website.
<a class="emph">It is your responsability to verify that the grades reported online corresponds
to your actual grades</a>. The grades on elearning range from 0 to 100, "M" means that you missed the test and "E" means that you provided a valid excuse. 
</p>
<p>
The final <a class="emph">minimum</a> grade will be A, B, C, or D, for averages of 90%, 80%, 65%, or 50%, respectively. 
</p>

<h2>Absences</h2>
<p>
I request that absences including for religious holy day are announced the first two weeks
of classes. 
When possible, other absences have to be arranged two weeks
prior the exam day.
</p>

<p>
Excused absences for the exams and final according to Rule seven
(see Student Rules) will be dealt with on an individual basis, 
but require convincing documentation. 
</p>

<p>Make-ups will <a class="emph">not</a> be given for quizzes. 
However if you miss a quiz due to an authorized absence and you
contact me immediately then the missed quiz will not count.
</p>

<h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</h2>
<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides
comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation
requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for
reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact Disability Services, in Cain Hall, Room B118, or call 845-1637. For
additional information visit <a href="http://disability.tamu.edu">http://disability.tamu.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</h2>
<p>
The Aggie Honor Code <a class="emph">''An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate
those who do''</a> applies, see also the Honor Council Rules and Procedures at
<a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu">http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu</a>.
Students are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss homework problems with each
other. However, copying or stealing work done by others is an act of academic dishonesty and
will be persecuted according to the University policy.
