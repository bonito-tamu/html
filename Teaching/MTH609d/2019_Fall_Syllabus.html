                    <p>
                    This is a one-semester course on numerical analysis which gives an introduction to various topics in numerical methods and provides a basis for future study. As well as lectures, there will be homework and programming assignments designed to provide concrete illustration of the proposed algorithms. It is suggested that the programming assignments be completed using MATLAB although other computing languages such as C, C++ or FORTRAN can also be used.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <strong>Prerequisites:</strong> Basic linear algebra and a course on ordinary differential equations. Familiarity with MATLAB programming or other modern computing language is also required.

                    <p>
                    Your grade in this class will be determined from your grades on the homework assignments. Each assignment will either require some basic math arguments or the completion of programming exercises illustrating the algorithms being studied in the class. It is important that you get your assignments done and uploaded in on time on <a target="_blank" href="http://elearning.tamu.edu">ecampus</a>.
                    All assignments will have due dates and late assignments may have points deducted. Really late assignments will not be accepted without a very good reason approved in advance.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    You have the possibility to check your grades via

                    <a class="emph">It is your responsability to verify that the grades reported online corresponds
                        to your actual grade</a>. The grades on elearning range from 0 to 100, "C" means that you completed the homewoek, "I" means you did not return the homework.

                    The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides
                    comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation
                    requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for
                    reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
                    accommodation, please contact Disability Services, in Cain Hall, Room B118, or call 845-1637. For

                    Students are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss homework problems with each
                    other. However, copying or stealing work done by others is an act of academic dishonesty and
                    will be persecuted according to the University policy.

			<h3 class="section-title">Title IX and Statement on Limits to Confidentiality</h3>

<p>
Texas A&amp;M University and the College of Science are committed to fostering a learning environment that is safe and productive for all. University policies and federal and state laws provide guidance for achieving such an environment. Although class materials are generally considered confidential pursuant to student record policies and laws, University employees — including instructors — cannot maintain confidentiality when it conflicts with their responsibility to report certain issues that jeopardize the health and safety of our community. As the instructor, I must report (per Texas A&amp;M System Regulation 08.01.01) the following information to other University offices if you share it with me, even if you do not want the disclosed information to be shared: Allegations of sexual assault, sexual discrimination, or sexual harassment when they involve TAMU students, faculty, or staff, or third parties visiting campus. 
</p>
<p>
These reports may trigger contact from a campus official who will want to talk with you about the incident that you have shared. In many cases, it will be your decision whether or not you wish to speak with that individual. If you would like to talk about these events in a more confidential setting, you are encouraged to make an appointment with the Student Counseling Service (<a href="https://scs.tamu.edu/" target=_blank>https://scs.tamu.edu</a>).
</p>
<p>
Students and faculty can report non-emergency behavior that causes them to be concerned at <a href="http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu" target="_blank">http://tellsomebody.tamu.edu</a>.
