<h2>Course description and prerequisites</h2> 

This is a one-semester course on numerical analysis which gives an introduction to various topics in numerical methods and provides a basis for future study. As well as lectures, there will be homework and programming assignments designed to provide concrete illustration of the proposed algorithms. It is suggested that the programming assignments be completed using MATLAB although other computing languages such as C, C++ or FORTRAN can also be used.
<br/>
<a class="emph">Prerequisites:</a> Basic linear algebra and a course on ordinary differential equations. Familiarity with MATLAB programming or other modern computing language is also required.

<h2>Minimal Outcome</h2> 

Interpolation, numerical evaluation of definite integrals and solution of ordinary differential equations; stability and convergence of methods and error estimates.

<h2>Class Format</h2>
The material covered in this class will be provided through lecture notes with accompanying audio. This material will be accessible through <a target=_top href="http://elearning.tamu.edu">ecampus</a>.

<h2>Grading Policy</h2>
<p>
Your grade in this class will be determined from your grades on the homework assignments. Each assignment will either require some basic math arguments or the completion of programming exercises illustrating the algorithms being studied in the class. It is important that you get your assignments done and uploaded in on time on <a target=_top href="http://elearning.tamu.edu">ecampus</a>. 
All assignments will have due dates and late assignments may have points deducted. Really late assignments will not be accepted without a very good reason approved in advance.
</p>
<p>
You have the possibility to check your grades via
the <a href="http://ecampus.tamu.edu" target="_blank">ecampus</a> website.
<a class="emph">It is your responsability to verify that the grades reported online corresponds
to your actual grade</a>. The grades on elearning range from 0 to 100, "C" means that you completed the homewoek, "I" means you did not return the homework.
</p>

<h2>Forum</h2>
A forum will be set on <a target=_top href="http://elearning.tamu.edu">ecampus</a> for you to discuss the homeworks among yourselves. I strongly encourage you to subscribe to the forum.


<h2>Office Hours</h2>
I will be holding office hours via skype. My skype account name is <a class=emph>andrea.bonito</a>. Please request me as a contact mentionning that you are in my 609d class.
If you are not able to call in during regular office hours,
you still have the possibility to schedule 
an skype appointment by email,
I will do my best to be available.


<h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</h2>
<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides
comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation
requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for
reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an
accommodation, please contact Disability Services, in Cain Hall, Room B118, or call 845-1637. For
additional information visit <a href="http://disability.tamu.edu">http://disability.tamu.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</h2>
<p>
The Aggie Honor Code <a class="emph">''An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate
those who do''</a> applies, see also the Honor Council Rules and Procedures at
<a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu">http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu</a>.
Students are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss homework problems with each
other. However, copying or stealing work done by others is an act of academic dishonesty and
will be persecuted according to the University policy.
