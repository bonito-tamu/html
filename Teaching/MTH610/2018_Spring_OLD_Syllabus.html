<h3>Course description</h3>

<p>
This is a one-semester course on numerical methods for partial differential equations. 
The course will focus on the basic concepts of the finite element method for elliptic boundary value problems. 
These will include a weak (variational) formulation of the problem and relies on the coercivity and continuity of certain bilinear forms in the simplest setting (and inf-sup condition in more general cases), approximation theory by piece-wise polynomial functions over partition of the domain into finite elements, error analysis, stability, and variational "crimes".
</p>     
<p>
Further, some basic techniques of finite differences and finite volumes will be introduced and discussed. Maximum principle, energy type estimates, and Fourier mode analysis will be used for studying the stability and accuracy of these methods applied to for elliptic, parabolic and hyperbolic problems.
</p>
<p>
The intention is to develop sufficient mathematical knowledge and expertise so after completing the class the students can read and understand fairly advances papers on various methods for PDEs (finite elements, finite differences, finite volumes). 
<!--For engineering students, the programming assignments will emphasize on the applications of the numerical techniques to engineering problems. -->
</p>
<p>
Prerequisite for this class are MATH 417 or 609 or equivalent. 
However, a basic knowledge of PDEs or engineering models that lead to boundary and initial value problems are essential. 
A good basis for this is Math602.
</p>

<h3>Practical Issues</h3>
<p>
Graphics, grid generation, program implementation and simple iterative techniques will be discussed (mostly in the labs) in order to help you with the programming assignments. 
Programming skills (e.g. C, C++ or Matlab) are essential.
You are not restricted to a specific programing language.
However, help will be provided only for C, C++ or Matlab implementations.
</p>
<p>
Students are encouraged to make their own project that is related to either to their research funded by the corresponding graduate program or to their personal interests and/or preferences. 
Such project will be used to replace one of the programming assignments. 
</p>

<h3>Homeworks</h3>
<p>
Periodically (every 2-3 weeks) homework and programming assignments posted on
the class website will be due.
There will be a 10% penalty for delaying the assignments to the next class. After that the asignements will not be accepted.
</p>

<p>
You have the possibility to check your grades via
the <a href="http://ecampus.tamu.edu" target="_blank">ecampus</em> website.
<a class="emph">It is your responsability to verify that the grades reported online corresponds
to your actual grades</a>. The grades on elearning range from 0 to 100, "M" means that you missed the test and "E" means that you provided a valid excuse. 
</p>


<p>Your MINIMUM grade will be A, B, C, or D, for averages of 90%, 75%, 60%, or
  50%, respectively. 
</p>
<p>

<h3>Absences</h3>
<p>
Excused absences for the exams 1 & 2 according to
Rule seven (see Student Rules) will be dealt with on an individual basis, but require convincing
documentation. 
Absences for religious holy day have to be arranged during the first two weeks of
classes. 
When possible, other absences have to be arranged two weeks prior the exam day.
</p>

<h3>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</h3>
<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. 
Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities.
</p>
<p>
If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, 
please contact Services for Students with Disabilities, Koldus 126, 845-1637 as
early as possible in order to find the best solution for you.
</p>

<h3>Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</h3>
<p>
The Aggie Honor Code <em>"An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do"</em> applies,
see also <a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu">the Honor Council Rules and Procedures</a>.
</p>
<p>
Students are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss homework problems with each
other. 
However, copying or stealing work done by others is an act of academic dishonesty and will
be persecuted according to the University policy.
