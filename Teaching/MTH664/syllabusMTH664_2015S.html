<h3>Course description</h3>

<p>
Deformable domains are ubiquitous in several areas of research but are
still a serious computational challenge.
We present a comprehensive approach to the formulation and discretization of geometric PDE governing processes relevant in biophysics and material science.
</p>
<p>
We start with key elements of differential geometry and shape differential calculus which enable us to compute (first) variations of domain and boundary functionals.
These tools are used in shape optimization, which is briefly discussed.
We introduce the mathematical framework of gradient flows and their approximations.
The latter is applied to geometric PDEs leading to the so-called geometric gradient flows proposed as a relaxation toward equilibrium.
We derive the corresponding dynamic equations together with their finite element approximations.
We apply this framework to mean curvature flow, surface diffusion, Helfrich flow (Willmore flow with area and volume constraints), and large bending deformations with isometry constraint.
</p>
<p>
This class is at the intersection of Partial Differential Equations, Differential Geometry and Numerical Approximation via Finite Elements.
However, no a-priori knowledge is needed as the required tools are going to be introduced in class.
In particular, no particular knowledge in differential geometry or finite element methods is required. 
</p>

<h3>Grading Policy</h3>
<p>
The grade will be based on a take home exam given at the end of the class.
</p>




<h3>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</h3>
<p>
The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. 
Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities.
</p>
<p>
If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, 
please contact Services for Students with Disabilities, Koldus 126, 845-1637 as
early as possible in order to find the best solution for you.
</p>



<h3>Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</h3>
<p>
The Aggie Honor Code <em>"An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate those who do"</em> applies,
see also <a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu">the Honor Council Rules and Procedures</a>.
</p>
<p>
Students are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss homework problems with each
other. 
However, copying or stealing work done by others is an act of academic dishonesty and will
be persecuted according to the University policy.
