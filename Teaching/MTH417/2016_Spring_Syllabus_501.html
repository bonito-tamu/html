<h2>Course description and prerequisites</h2> 
This is a one-semester course on numerical numerical analysis which gives an introduction to various topics in numerical methods. In particular, the class covers 
<ol>
 <li>iterative methods in one dimension,</li>
 <li>interpolation and polynomial approximation,</li>
 <li>numerical differentiation and integration,</li>
 <li>direct methods for linear systems,</li>
 <li>iterative methods for linear systems,</li>
 <li>numerical approximation of ordinary differential equations,</li>
 <li>extra topics (if time permits).</li>
</ol>
<br/>
Note that 
<a class="emph">it is impossible to cover all the material provided in the textbook and some material will be omitted.</a>

<h2>Minimal Outcome</h2> 
This course is to provide students with basic, yet critical, tools in numerical analysis and scientific computation. 
The students should be able to master their principles, understand their mathematical properties and implement them in matlab.  

<h2>Homework and Matlab Assignements</h2> 
<p>
Homework will be assigned in a regular basis (~weekly).
In general, they will contain analytic and matlab exercises.
They will not be announced in class but be posted on the <a target="_blank" href="/~bonito/Teaching/HTML/MTH417_2016S.html">class web site</a>
one week prior the due date.
Solving the problems diligently is a vital component of your learning experience and will also prepare you for the exams. 
</p>

<p>
Due to new Texas A&amp;M regulation, the homeworks and exams are not returned in class anymore. 
Instead, you are welcome to pick your copies up during office hours.
However, note that any discussion on your grade will be only possible within 2 weeks (starting when the copies were returned). 
</p>

<p>
Help session for matlab are provided by the department of mathematics, visit
<a target="_blank" href="/courses/calclabhelp.html">Calc Lab</a>.
</p>

<h2>Office Hours</h2>
You have priority over graduate students and other people I work with
during my office hours.
You are welcome to stop by without appointment during the office
hours.
<a class="emph">Please use the office hours!</a>
If you are not able to come during regular office hours,
you still have the possibility to schedule 
an appointment by email,
I will do my best to be available.


<h2>Grading Policies</h2> 
Examination dates and the recipe for your final grade are as follows:
<ul>
<li> Homeworks: 30 %</li> 
<li> Midterm: 35 %, March 10</li>
<li> Final: 35 %, May 10, 1:00 pm - 3:00 pm</li> 
</ul>

<p>
The lowest homework is dropped.
Assignement turned late lose 5% per class. 
</p>
<p>
You have the possibility to check your grades via
the <a href="http://ecampus.tamu.edu" target="_blank">ecampus</a> website.
<a class="emph">It is your responsability to verify that the grades reported online corresponds
to your actual grade</a>. The grades on elearning range from 0 to 100, "N" means that you did not return the homework.
</p>
<p>
The final <a class="emph">minimum</a> grade will be A, B, C, or D, for averages of 90%, 80%, 65%, or 55%, respectively. 
</p>

<h2>Absences</h2>
<p>
I request that absences including for religious holy day are announced the first two weeks
of classes. 
When possible, other absences have to be arranged two weeks
prior the exam day.
</p>

<p>
Excused absences for the exams and final according to Rule seven
(see Student Rules) will be dealt with on an individual basis, 
but require convincing documentation. 
</p>


<h2>Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Policy Statement</h2>
<p>


The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) is a federal anti-discrimination statute that provides comprehensive civil rights protection for persons with disabilities. Among other things, this legislation requires that all students with disabilities be guaranteed a learning environment that provides for reasonable accommodation of their disabilities. If you believe you have a disability requiring an accommodation, please contact Disability Services, currently located in the Disability Services building at the Student Services at White Creek complex on west campus or call 979-845-1637. For additional information, visit <a target=_blank href="http://disability.tamu.edu">http://disability.tamu.edu</a>.
</p>

<h2>Academic Integrity Statement and Policy</h2>
<p>
The Aggie Honor Code <a class="emph">''An Aggie does not lie, cheat or steal, or tolerate
those who do''</a> applies, see also the Honor Council Rules and Procedures at
<a href="http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu">http://aggiehonor.tamu.edu</a>.
Students are strongly encouraged to work together and discuss homework problems with each
other. However, copying or stealing work done by others is an act of academic dishonesty and
will be persecuted according to the University policy.
